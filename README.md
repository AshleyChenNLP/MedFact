## MedFact

Medical fact-checking has become increasingly critical as more individuals seek medical information online. However, existing datasets predominantly focus on human-generated content, leaving the verification of content generated by large language models (LLMs) relatively unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce **MedFact**, the first evidence-based Chinese medical fact-checking dataset of LLM-generated medical content. It consists of **1,321 questions** and **7,409 claims**, mirroring the complexities of real-world medical scenarios.
